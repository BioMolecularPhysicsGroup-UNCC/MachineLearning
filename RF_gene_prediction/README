### Instructions for use of random forest gene prediction method ###

Requires Python3 and R

1. Set fasta file name in Sensor_data.py

2. run using:

python3 Sensor_data.py

3. Set working directory and fasta file name in RF_predictions.R

4. Run using:

Rscript RF_predictions.R

5. Set working directory and fasta file name in CDS_predictions.py

6. Run using:
